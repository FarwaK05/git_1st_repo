# 7- Line Breaks or page breaks:

For line breaks or page breaks we use three different methods:

- First method is using using  ( - ) times in the start of the line:

**Like this:**

---

**Like this :**

___

- Third method is using ( * ) three times in the start of line.

**Like this:**

# 8- Links and Hyperlinks:
## 1-QR code:
>*For giving anf kind of link we write the link between (<>)*:
 
 **Like This:**
 >***Link mentioned below is link of video from which i learned this markdown language*** :

 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJqAXjz-Rh4&list=PL9XvIvvVL50HVsu-Ao8NBr0UJSO8O6lBI&index=21&ab_channel=Codanics>

 >*For creating the hyperlink we write the text in square brakets ( [ ] )  and the link in round brakets ( ).*

**The result will be ike this :**

 ## Images and Figures with the links:

 > In order to add any QR code saved in our folder we can simply write it down like:

 QR in these [ ] square brackets and can qr.png in   these ( ) round brackets.
 
 It will give result like :

 [QR](qr.png)

 > In order to add Qr to scan we use ( ! ) is symbole in the start of  ([QR])
### Note:
> ***For comment down in markdown we use  -->
 and ! and then two dashes (-) -->
and use two dashes(-) , ! is symbol and > symbol in end to close the comment.***

> ***The shortcut for comment down in markdown in ctrl + / .***

## 2- Online Pictures:

**For showing online picture we simply use ! before square bracket [ ] and can write the likin of picture with it in ( ).**

# 9- Code writing Or Block writing :
> *for code writing  we use ticks (``) with the code to seperate it from other text like :*

*For writning the string in python we use ` print("This is string.")`.*

> *In order to add block of code we use three ticks (``) on the start and the nd of code, in oder to make the block of code.*

We can write block of code like this:

```
print("This is string")
a = 10
b = 12
print(a+b)
```
>***Code in python language:***
```python 
print("This is string")
a = 10
b = 12
print(a+b)
```
>***Code in R language :***
```R
print("This is string")
a = 10
b = 12
print(a+b)
```
# 10- Adding Tables:
>**For moving the text to the middle we use( : ) on the both side of (|---|).** 

>**And for moving test to the right side  we use ( : ) at the right side of (|---|).**

>**And for moving test to the left we use ( : ) at the left side of (|---|).**

| Column_1   |  Column_2  | Column_3 |
| :--------: | :------: | :------:  | 
| C1_R1 | C2_R1 | C3_R1 |
| C1_R2 | C2_R2 | C3_R2 |
| C1_R3 | C2_R3 | C3_R3 |
